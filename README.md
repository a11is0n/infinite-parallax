infinite-parallax
=================

Parallax effect based on mouse movement; clicking moves "forward" infinitely.

Inspired by GitHub's [cute](https://github.com/about "GitHub about page")
[parallax](https://github.com/404 "GitHub 404 page")
[effects](https://github.com/500 "GitHub 500 page") based on mouse movement, and
a friend who suggested moving forward.

Colors are based on the [design seeds](http://design-seeds.com/ "design seeds")
palette "[a door hue](http://design-seeds.com/index.php/home/entry/a-door-hue
"a door hue")".  Images are by me, done crudely in Illustrator, and inspired by
the color palette.

If I get bored in the future I may make different themes; the way I've written
it now, it woudldn't require too many tweeks, as I've assumed all images (other
than the background) are the same size, and I calculate values based on the 
image size, which is retrieved in the JavaScript after loading one of them.
